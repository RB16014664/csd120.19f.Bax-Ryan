<main><h1>Welcome to Ryan Bax&apos;s CSD120 Website</h1>
    <p>I am a college student currently enrolled in the computer programming course of fall 2019. I have previously attended Sault College over the past few years taking various courses. 
    </p>
    <p>I currently work at final touch doing general property maintence. The job is labourous for the pay but has really flexable hours and a understanding and reasonable boss.
